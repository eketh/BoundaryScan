README
======

Materials regarding my master thesis whose point is to describe the history, development and terminology related to JTAG standards (and to make use of Test Access Port and prototyped JTAG interface, both written in VHDL).

SOFTWARE

In the early stage: DE2-115 board by Altera.
Now: Spartan 3E.

Soft - for the time being, WIP is the only relevant directory that contains "rapid prototyping" project written in VHDL.
